# Homework Assignment 1



## Description

In this project I refactored the clients html and css files to make them easy to read, understand, and maintainable.


For example:

```
<!-- Here i added an *id tag* of 'search-engin-optimization' so the link would work above-->

<div class="search-engine-optimization" id="search-engine-optimization">

```

```
/* Created this to *combine* elemnts to align center */

footer, .benefit-lead h3, .benefit-brand h3, .benefit-cost h3 {
text-align: center;

}

```

## Usage
use the *index.html* to further improve the code 
use the *style.css* file to further improve css functioning
use the *assets/images* file to store and add additional photos


## Work Completed

- Refactored HTML to meet HTML 5 guidelines, corrected broken links
- Refactored CSS by organizing by groups and combining code to reduce footprint
